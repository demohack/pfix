2020-12-10 preparing new checklists project folder
Objective: provide a basic web app javascript on front end, live updates using json to backend, website hosted using python / flask, and msyql database

A good source code control is needed, and git is a good tool to use. It's what I'm learning. Github is a secured repository, owned by microsoft.

Development & Ops Workflow:
- code files will be created / edited on the desktop or laptop from work or home
- code changes are committed securely to my personal github account "demohack"
- then code is pulled / synced locally to the development server
- dev ready code will sync to the dev folder, with webpage served on intranet port X
- test ready code will sync to a test folder, with webpage served on port intranet port Y
- production ready code will sync to the production folder, and webpage served on intranet port Z

Security
- workplace configuration files, database files, other files with names of people, or computers, databases, other private data will be stored in a separate folder on the server that does not get committed using git
- I'm the only person who can commit changes to my repository
- the account is protected by two-factor authentication
