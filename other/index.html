    <h1>I will tell you a story about an eagle.</h1>
    <h2>This is a short story.</h2>

    <p> Once, there was an eagle that flew higher in the skies,
        <br> touching upon the tip of the mountains </p>
    <p> One day she found a ring stuck in the branch of an apple tree.
        <br> She took it and flew to her nest. While playing with it, she got her head stuck in it.
        <br> She didn't panic or hit her head on the stump of a tree to get rid of it.
        <br> Instead, she embraced it as a mark of distinction among fellow eagles.
        <br> Then, one day she drenched her head in oil and the ring came off of her neck.</p>
